["pin-perfect-wedding-personalized-vendor-recommendations-using-pinterest-boards-.html", "Pin-Perfect Wedding {#Personalized vendor recommendations using Pinterest boards.} The wedding of your dreams, without the stress Pin-Personalized Your wedding, Your Recommendations", " Pin-Perfect Wedding {#Personalized vendor recommendations using Pinterest boards.} Keywords wedding, recommendations, pinterest, personalized The wedding of your dreams, without the stress Wedding services are a $76 billion industry, and it is a time-intensive and difficult market to navigate. Current popular wedding planning platforms, such as Wedding Wire and The Knot rely heavily on user ratings and reviews. Not only are these types of recommendations impersonal, they require users to do significant research clicking through dozens of vendor options, browsing pop-up images, and filtering through customer reviews in the search to find the right vendor. Those with the time to do this research can get bogged down in the details, or suffer from decision fatigue, which detracts from the joy and excitement of the upcoming marriage. On the other hand, busier individuals often resort to expensive wedding planners. Pin-Perfect Wedding is for the brides and grooms who have a good sense of what they want in a wedding, but who want to avoid the stress of sifting through irrelevant vendors. Pin-Personalized Every year, 40 million people use Pinterest to find inspiration for their weddings by looking through and pinning images from other users. Pinterest allows wedding planning couples to save visual wish lists and show family, friends, and vendors what they want. Combined these wish lists are a rich dataset of 900 million Pins a year about weddings with pictures, tags, and social connections. Pin-Perfect Wedding leverages these Pinterest boards to learn a couple’s vision. With preferences identified, Pin-Perfect wedding will search through data scrapped from online directories to find vendors whose pictures and descriptions resonate with a couple’s dream. Be it rustic, contemporary, or Disney-themed, Pin-Perfect Wedding can analyze Pins that a couple already likes, and pair them with vendors who can deliver. Not only will these recommendations save dozens of hours, they will get couples more excited about their big day by showing them vendors that can give them what they want. Your wedding, Your Recommendations Vendor recommendations should be more than sorting by 4+ stars and combing through the same reviews as everyone else. If you know what you want, you shouldn’t have to look through vendors that can’t provide or hire a planner to do it for you. Pin-Perfect Wedding’s personalized recommendations will make looking through vendors a lot more fun and easy. Our recommendations can’t help make seating arrangements for your warring cousins and you will still need to read reviews to be sure a vendor is real, but they will get you to your dream wedding faster.

["intake-bot-automatic-legal-intake.html", "Intake Bot {#Automatic Legal Intake} Legal Intake – A drag on providing services The Intake Bot Solution Fixing Intake Matters", " Intake Bot {#Automatic Legal Intake} Keywords legal, intake, NLP Legal Intake – A drag on providing services Legal aid organizations do tremendous good. They help elders keep their Social Security, make sure wages get paid, and that there is family support. But determining which cases they can actually help is a long and tedious process of legal specialists fielding calls and messages (intake). Everyday legal services specialists field nearly a hundred intake messages. They must decide which messages represent actionable cases and which don’t. The process requires a lot of work from determining the relevant area of law, to identifying legal elements, and finally assessing whether the elements are met. The longer the process takes, the fewer people are able to receive legal services they need to retain their benefits, immigration status, or even homes. Intake Bot leverages natural language processing to automatically handle intake so that legal service organizations can focus their time on helping people. The Intake Bot Solution Intake Bot is built upon years of intake data from legal services across the country. Past cases are labeled by category and detail the back and forth conversations regarding the merits of the case. When new intake comes in, Intake Bot mines the intake message while comparing it with prior intakes. In the first processing step, the case category is determined. Then, a cross reference to WestLaw/LexisNexus is used to lookup applicable, current caselaw and regulations and extract the elements required for a client to get the outcome they want. Intake Bot then uses the contents of the message to place the intake into one of three categories: meritorious, further communication, or unfruitful. Meritorious cases have a clear legal category and meet all the required elements. They are immediately passed on to the appropriate division of the legal services organization with the case outlined by the elements with a summary of the information contained in the intake applicable to each element. Further communication cases also have a defined legal category, but could use additional clarifying information to determine how promising that are. In this case, Intake Bot can respond to the intake submitter with an outline of what it believes the legal issue to be and where it requires more information. When they respond, Intake Bot will repeat the process. Unfruitful cases do not have clearly defined goal or legal issue. Here, Intake Bot would inform the submitter that their issue did not match a standard legal issue and could point them to more general help in the area if applicable. If the submitter believed their case to be valid, there could be an appeal process for them to get a manual review so that cases don’t fall through the cracks. Fixing Intake Matters Fielding a single intake can take up to 20 days of back and forth communication before it is determined to be a case worth pursuing. This triaging is valuable time that could be spent advocating for clients with meritorious cases. Intake Bot frees this time by automatically summarizing key elements and requesting required information. Though there may be some unclear cases that require some review by a specialist, Intake Bot will make sure the best cases make it to the front of the line so you can focus your time making a difference.
