## About the author {-}

Dan is a Data Scientist and Project Manager at Alivia Technology. Dan graduated Phi Beta Kappa, Sigma Xi, and Magna Cum Laude from Brown University with a degree in applied mathematics. At Brown, he teamed up with researchers at Merck to analyze fMRI and DTI image time series. He won the Rohn Truell prize for best applied math thesis in his class.

After college, Dan joined Teach For America and taught at one of the lowest performing middle schools in all of California. He was nominated for the LMU Outstanding Urban Teacher Award and the Sue Lehmann Award. Dan then worked at the MA Attorney General’s Office in the antitrust division. His data analytics helped provide the evidence to prevent a hospital merger that was predicted to cost MA taxpayers $26M a year. While working at the state Attorney General’s Office, Dan applied and got into Harvard Law School. However, he believed he would be able to have a larger positive impact by focusing on data analytics and decided to instead work as a litigation consultant with a focus on healthcare. The cases he analyzed included a multi-billion dollar pharmacy merger and an analysis of outpatient surgery center claims focused on overbilling representing Aetna, Cigna, BCBS, and United. Dan now works at Alivia Technology where he continues to use his expertise to analyze health data.
